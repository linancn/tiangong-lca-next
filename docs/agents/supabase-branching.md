# Supabase Environment And Database Workflow

> Purpose: exact ownership and environment rules for frontend work that touches Supabase-related behavior.

## Use When

- choosing the correct environment for frontend validation
- deciding whether a change belongs here, in `database-engine`, or in `edge-functions`
- checking webhook secret rules

## Do Not Use For

- authoring schema migrations
- editing Supabase branch config
- defining database truth

## Ownership Split

| Repo | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `database-engine` | schema truth, migrations, seeds, Supabase config, branch-governance workflow, database-side preview behavior |
| `tiangong-lca-next` | frontend env selection, app-side Supabase clients, frontend validation |
| `edge-functions` | Edge Function runtime code |

## Environment Contract

| Need                             | Command              |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| shared persistent `dev`          | `npm start`          |
| explicit shared persistent `dev` | `npm run start:dev`  |
| explicit `main` verification     | `npm run start:main` |

Rules:

- routine feature and fix work starts from Git `dev` and targets `dev`
- do not infer the working trunk from GitHub default-branch UI alone
- do not create ad-hoc Supabase clients outside `src/services/**`

## Common Scenarios

| Scenario | Correct workflow |
| --- | --- |
| app-only change | work in this repo, use `dev`, validate here |
| schema-related feature | start in `database-engine`, validate the database branch there, then validate this repo against the relevant environment |
| `main` investigation or hotfix verification | use `npm run start:main` only for that scoped task |

## Database-Side Webhook Secrets

Database-triggered Edge Function calls do not read this repo's frontend env files.

They depend on branch-specific Vault secrets on the active Supabase branch:

- `project_url`
- `project_secret_key`
- `project_x_key` only for legacy `generate_flow_embedding()` compatibility

Do not hardcode branch URLs or service keys in app code, SQL, or dumped baseline files.
