# Team Management Reference

> Purpose: exact role and flow rules for the team-management domain.

## Roles

| Role     | Allowed actions                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `owner`  | invite users, delete users, set user roles, modify team information |
| `admin`  | invite users, delete users, modify team information                 |
| `member` | view only                                                           |

## Entry Flow: My Team

| User state             | Result                                       |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| user already in a team | show team information and member information |
| user not in a team     | prompt to join a team or create a team       |

## Join vs Create Flow

| Action        | Result                                                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| join a team   | show teams with `rank >= 0`; user contacts the team by email to join |
| create a team | user fills team information and becomes the owner after creation     |

## Member-Management Rule

Member-management actions are always role-gated:

- `owner`: full team-management surface
- `admin`: limited team-management surface
- `member`: no management actions

## Review Workflow Boundary

Team `owner` and `admin` roles do not assign, review, approve, reject, repair, or receive notifications for Root/Reference Reviews. Review Admin and Review Member remain the only review roles, while each dataset owner remains responsible for repairing and resubmitting rejected data.

Existing team membership and dataset visibility may determine whether a submitter can already read and reference another owner's draft. Review submission must not grant new team or cross-team access. Result notifications go only to the affected dataset owner.
