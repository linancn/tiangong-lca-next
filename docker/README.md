# Self-Hosted Supabase with Docker

This is the official Docker Compose setup for self-hosted Supabase. It provides a complete stack with all Supabase services running locally or on your infrastructure.

## Getting Started

Follow the detailed setup guide in our documentation: [Self-Hosting with Docker](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker)

## Project Sync Workflows

This project includes two sync workflows used to keep self-hosted assets aligned with upstream services.

### 1) Sync Edge Functions

Script: `docker/pull-edge-functions.sh`

Behavior:
- Require one reviewed full Edge commit SHA instead of following a moving ref.
- Resolve that ref to one exact commit.
- Replace `docker/volumes/functions/` with a delete-aware mirror of `supabase/functions/`.
- Record the repository and resolved commit in `docker/volumes/functions/.source-revision.json`.

Command:

```bash
cd /path/to/tiangong-lca-next
./docker/pull-edge-functions.sh --ref <reviewed-40-character-edge-commit>
```

Use another repository only for an explicit local or fork validation:

```bash
./docker/pull-edge-functions.sh \
  --repo /path/to/tiangong-lca-edge-functions \
  --ref <reviewed-40-character-edge-commit>
```

The helper is safe to invoke from another working directory because it resolves
the target from its own location. It removes stale mirror files; review the
complete generated diff before committing it.

### 2) Generate `data.sql` From a Reviewed Database Rebuild

Script: `docker/scripts/sync-migrations-to-data-sql.sh`

Requirements:

- Use a disposable local database rebuilt only from the reviewed `database-engine` migrations, without business seeds, Auth users, OAuth registrations, jobs, or datasets. Never point this workflow at production or shared Dev.
- Set `DATABASE_SOURCE_ROOT` to that clean owning checkout and `DATABASE_SOURCE_COMMIT` to its full reviewed SHA. The helper verifies checkout identity and the database migration head.
- `REMOTE_DB_URL` retains its historical name but must now use `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `host.docker.internal`. A Docker client normally uses `host.docker.internal` with the isolated database's port. Invalid/remote addresses are rejected without printing credentials.

Command:

```bash
cd /path/to/tiangong-lca-next
DATABASE_SOURCE_ROOT=/path/to/database-engine \
DATABASE_SOURCE_COMMIT=<reviewed-40-character-database-commit> \
REMOTE_DB_URL='postgresql://postgres:<local-password>@host.docker.internal:54322/postgres' \
  ./docker/scripts/sync-migrations-to-data-sql.sh
```

Check-only mode (no file changes; use the same source environment):

```bash
./docker/scripts/sync-migrations-to-data-sql.sh --check
```

What the script does:
- Verify a migration-only empty source and record its exact commit/migration head in the snapshot
- Pull a full schema-only dump with `pg_dump --schema-only`
- Run `docker/desensitize_data.sql.sh` automatically
- Keep `api`, `private`, `public`, `util`, `archive`, `pgmq`, and required business extensions
- Export the three constrained Database executor roles, their effective reviewed memberships, the OAuth pre-request setting, the exact Database-owned Auth-to-private-user synchronization trigger and nine allowlisted migration-owned catalogs; no user/business rows or credential catalogs are copied
- Recreate the two reviewed logged queues through `pgmq.create` as their `postgres` owner, then restore the Database-owned embedding visibility fence. Copying `pgmq.meta` rows alone does not create the extension-owned queue/archive tables
- Preserve the global `postgres` default-function ACL that revokes PUBLIC execution and clear the base image's broader public-schema defaults before restoring the reviewed grants. PG17 administrative-only creator memberships are omitted instead of becoming effective PG15 memberships; mixed INHERIT/SET flags fail before export
- Remove Supabase base-managed schemas/objects (for example `auth`, `extensions`, `graphql*`, `storage`, `supabase_functions`) and obvious PG17 dump noise such as `\restrict`, `\unrestrict`, and `SET transaction_timeout = 0;`
- Write the filtered result to `docker/volumes/db/init/data.sql`

The Docker image remains PostgreSQL 15.8. The filter removes only PG17's unsupported `MAINTAIN` token from table ACL blocks; it grants no replacement privilege and leaves function bodies unchanged. Existing canonical function-body whitespace is preserved. Supabase-managed Auth/Storage migrations and webhook setup remain owned by their existing pinned services/base initialization, not this snapshot.

The current pair is Edge `ceff9c4893e6fa9ab2b6e163c57b9d6428cbde37` and Database `e9888c9385356ee6df66c2910a99e29f9fa7e08c` (migration head `20260905170004`). Both Hybrid entrypoints forward visibility/selected-team context to their V2 RPCs; Process also forwards the dataset-type filter. Omitted and explicit `latest` Process/Flow requests preserve the legacy RPC arguments and Edge threshold retry; matched mode keeps Database-owned V2 fallback. The snapshot contract checks that pairing and the three executor roles.

This is a **fresh-install initializer**, not an upgrade script for an existing database volume. Existing installs must apply Database-owned migrations through their operator workflow, retain backups, and include `api` in `PGRST_DB_SCHEMAS`; never expose `private`, `util`, or `archive`. Run the generator twice (`--check` on the second run), the snapshot contract test, and an isolated restore against the pinned Docker database plus its normal Auth migrations before updating the committed artifact.

Desensitization rules include:
- `"x_key":"<any>"` -> `"x_key":"edge-functions-key"`
- `"apikey":"sb_secret_..."` -> `"apikey":"edge-functions-key"`
- Remaining `sb_secret_*` -> `sb_secret_REDACTED`

Deprecated compatibility wrapper:
- `docker/scripts/sync-lca-migrations-to-data-sql.sh` forwards to `sync-migrations-to-data-sql.sh`

## Important Notes

### Security

⚠️ **The default configuration is not secure for production use.**

Before deploying to production, you must:
- Update all default passwords and secrets in the `.env` file
- Generate new JWT secrets
- Review and update CORS settings
- Consider setting up a secure proxy in front of self-hosted Supabase
- Review and adjust network security configuration (ACLs, etc.)
- Set up proper backup procedures

See the [security section](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker#configuring-and-securing-supabase) in the documentation.
